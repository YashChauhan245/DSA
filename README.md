Welcome! This repository contains my daily practice solutions to **LeetCode DSA (Data Structures & Algorithms)** problems.  
I'm solving at least **5 problems a day** and organizing them by topic for better revision and tracking.


## ðŸš€ Goal

> Solve 5+ LeetCode problems every day  
> Stay consistent and build strong DSA foundations  
> Track my growth publicly and share my learning journey


Each folder represents a DSA topic. Inside each folder are the corresponding problem solutions.
